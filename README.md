Project Name: Codeless IDE
Core Language: C (for smooth performance, memory efficiency, and low-level system control)
Type: Next-generation AI-powered IDE
Goal: Build an advanced, multi-language coding environment that integrates AI assistance, design tools, real-time collaboration, and inbuilt app/database management.

‚∏ª

üéØ MVP Vision

Codeless IDE will be the fastest, AI-native coding IDE, combining the best features of:
	‚Ä¢	VS Code (multi-language support + extensions)
	‚Ä¢	Cursor IDE / Blackbox AI (AI-assisted coding)
	‚Ä¢	Figma (UI/UX design integration)
	‚Ä¢	Xcode/Android Studio (mobile app editing + live preview)
	‚Ä¢	GitHub Desktop (built-in version control)

It should allow developers to code, design, test, debug, and share live projects from a single platform.
